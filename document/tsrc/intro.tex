IOb-Eth is an Ethernet MAC IP core written in Verilog, which users can download
for free, modify, simulate and implement in FPGA.  The core supports 10/100 Mbps
operation, featuring PHY, MDIO MDC, control and data interfaces. The control
interface supports AXI-Lite, Wishbone, and the native IOb bus. The data
interface supports AXI4 optionally the data can be driven through the control
interface. It can run in baremetal or Linux using the open source Ethmac Linux
drivers. The IP core can be synthesized fro both ASICs and FPGAs.
